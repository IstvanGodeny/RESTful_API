## Houses database RESTful API. 

The database has information about houses, such as type, number of floors, number of rooms and so on.
Using different methods, users can interact with the server to get, add, update, or even delete entries.

I plan some development, namely:
- API_KEY handling for significant actions like delete, update or even add a new entry
- Limit the number of requests per minute
- Capability to use a JSON body to handle the parameters

Please note that this is a demo project, created as part of my learning journey as a junior Python developer. I focused on building a functional, maintainable, and visually clean app, without unnecessary complexity.

The following methods can be used:
GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
